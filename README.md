## About

This is a collection of simple Rails applications. Each demonstrates the use of a common pattern, gem or programming practice. I create and compile these on a daily basis for reference and practice.

Each project includes a README with a short description, notes, gotchas and instructions for running tests and deploying to Heroku.
